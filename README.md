Morse code, also called Morse alphabet, is a system for transmitting letters, numbers and punctuation marks by means of an intermittent coded signal and was one of the first methods of remote communication. Another method to use the morse code is with the fingers following this legend: to express the point you can use the index, for the dash you can use the index and the middle.
